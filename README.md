<p align="center">Move.it is a project created by Rocketseat initially to be a platform that combines the technique of pomodoro, which consists of alternating cycles of focus and rest, with exercises for well-being for those who spend many hours in front of a computer, which can be harmful to health when you do no exercise or take periods of rest!</p>
